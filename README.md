### CLUB MANAGEMENT SYSTEM


https://cmsweb.herokuapp.com/
A webapp with backend made using Django which allows different club representatives to request for funds/rooms online.
It saves all the time that is wasted in approaching different departments for approval and the status of request updates within seconds as the approval/disapproval is made via the management.

It will be a major step in connecting societies with the management, requests made will directly go to the different departments within a click and will hence reduce the time taken to both make a request and
approve it. This will provide more transparency than the existing in-person management technique as every request made will be stored in database and be backed up in cloud. The dashboard will be displaying the
current status of application in real-time, and will be updated as the database fetch results from the feedback cum approval form that will be mailed to the management bodies, directly from the system itself. The
backend is made in Django, a fast, secure, and scalable web framework that is really easy to maintain.
